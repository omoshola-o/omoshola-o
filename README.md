# Hi, I'm Omoshola 👋

**Building AI agents and the infrastructure they run on.**

I work at the intersection of agentic systems, financial AI, and regulatory governance — where the gap between what AI can do and what institutions can trust is still wide open. I build AI systems that are architecturally precise, auditable, and honest about uncertainty.

Published research: 100+ citations across ethical AI in financial decisioning, credit risk modeling, supply chain finance, and systemic risk.

### What I'm Thinking About

- How to engineer **trustworthy agent systems over time**, not just at launch.
- How to operationalize SHAP/LIME-style explainability so adverse-action reasons satisfy **ECOA/FCRA** requirements in real workflows.
- How to build credit models that expand access for people historically excluded by formal scoring systems.
- How to combine uncertainty quantification, calibration, and drift monitoring into continuous model governance.
- What memory, identity, policy, and reasoning primitives are required before agents can safely operate in regulated domains.
- How to use privacy-preserving synthetic data to balance data utility, security, and compliance.
- How African knowledge systems can inform modern computation and AI system design.

### Technical Focus

- **Modeling:** explainable ML, ensemble risk models, time-series forecasting (ARIMA + neural), supplier-risk scoring.
- **AI Safety & Governance:** model transparency, adverse-action traceability, policy-aware decision systems, regulatory-compliant AI deployment.
- **Data & Privacy:** synthetic data generation (Gaussian Copula + GAN), anonymization, utility-preserving data pipelines.
- **Agent Infrastructure:** graph-native memory, multimodal retrieval, identity and trust primitives, temporal reasoning, contract-constrained actions.
