# Hi, I'm Omoshola 👋

**Building AI agents and the infrastructure they run on.**

I work at the intersection of agentic systems, financial AI, and regulatory governance — where the gap between what AI can do and what institutions can trust is still wide open. I build things that are architecturally precise, auditable, and honest about what they do not know.

### Current Projects

- 🦀 **Nexus** — Supply chain intelligence platform in Rust. Treats demand, lead times, and supplier reliability as probability distributions. Monte Carlo simulation, temporal graph kernel, agentic recommendations a procurement team can audit.
- 💳 **FyxCred** — Credit intelligence built on behavioral cashflow data, not bureau scores. Three scores — financial health, income stability, financial resilience — with a consent-first data layer and bias transparency framework.
- 🕸️ **[Cortex](https://github.com/agentic-revolution/agentic-vision)** — Web cartography for AI agents. Maps entire sites into navigable binary graphs in seconds. Ships with WQL (a query language for websites), LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen/MCP integrations.
- 🧠 **[AgenticMemory](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-memory)** — Persistent memory for AI agents. A binary graph format that stores facts, decisions, corrections, and reasoning chains with semantic edge types.

### Agentra Sisters

| Sister | Artifact | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [**AgenticMemory**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-memory) | `.amem` | Persistent cognitive graph memory — facts, decisions, corrections, reasoning chains |
| [**AgenticVision**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-vision) | `.avis` | Persistent visual memory — embeddings, similarity search, and visual diff |
| [**AgenticCodebase**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-codebase) | `.acb` | Semantic code intelligence — concept graphs, impact analysis, coupling detection |
| [**AgenticIdentity**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-identity) | `.aid` | Cryptographic agent identity — signed receipts, trust delegation, and authority lineage |
| [**AgenticTime**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-time) | `.atime` | Temporal reasoning — schedules, deadlines, decay, sequence analysis |
| [**AgenticContract**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-contract) | `.acon` | Policy engine — governance rules, approvals, obligations, and violations |
| [**AgenticComm**](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-comm) | `.acomm` | Communication runtime — channels, pub/sub routing, messaging, acknowledgments |

### What I'm Doing

🦀 Building Nexus — a full supply chain OS in Rust with probabilistic planning and agentic recommendations  
💳 Speccing and starting FyxCred — cashflow-based credit intelligence for the credit invisible  
🕸️ Shipping Cortex — web cartography infrastructure for AI agents  
🧠 Building Agentra sister systems — memory, vision, codebase, identity, time, contract, and comm  
📝 Reviewing AI and cybersecurity research for IEEE

### What I'm Thinking About

- What it actually means for an AI agent to be trustworthy over time — not just at launch
- How credit scoring can work for people the formal system has historically excluded
- The memory and reasoning infrastructure agents need before they can operate in regulated environments
- African knowledge systems and their relationship to computation and intelligence
