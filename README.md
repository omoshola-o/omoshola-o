# Hi, I'm Omoshola 👋

**Vienna × London — Supply chain engineer by day, payment infrastructure builder by night.**

Deep in enterprise systems, AI research, and fintech infrastructure. Currently a **Supply Chain Planning Specialist at IBM** and founder of **ZexRail** — payment infrastructure for Nigeria. I build things that are architecturally precise, auditable, and production-grade.
