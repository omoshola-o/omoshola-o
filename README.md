# Hey, I'm Omoshola 👋

**Supply chain engineer by day, payment infrastructure builder by night.**

I sit at the intersection of enterprise systems, AI research, and fintech infrastructure. Originally from Nigeria, now based in the United States — building systems that are architecturally precise, auditable, and production-grade.

Currently a **Supply Chain Planning Specialist at IBM** and founder of **ZexRail**, payment infrastructure for Nigeria.

### Current Projects

💳 **ZexRail** — Payment infrastructure for Nigeria. A "truth ledger" that operates alongside money flows — not within them. Orchestrates payments across banks, mobile money, and cards with institutional-grade reliability. Includes ZexPay UI (merchant), Control Plane UI (ops), and ZexRail Authority UI (regulatory).

🛡️ **AgentLedger** — Open-source trust & audit layer for OpenClaw agents. Cryptographic provenance, execution logging, and compliance hooks — built to integrate as a native skill with OpenClaw's code quality standards.

🔬 **CrossSHAP** — Explainable AI research methodology for cross-domain feature interaction analysis. Published work demonstrating superior performance across fidelity, consistency, and computational efficiency vs. LIME and standard SHAP.

🎬 **EryonPaid** — Automated video content generation pipeline powered by AI.
