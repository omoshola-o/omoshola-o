# Hi, I'm Omoshola 👋

**Building AI agents and the infrastructure they run on.**

I work at the intersection of agentic systems, financial AI, and regulatory governance — where the gap between what AI can do and what institutions can trust is still wide open. I build things that are architecturally precise, auditable, and honest about what they do not know.

Published research: 100+ citations across ethical AI in financial decisioning, credit risk modeling, supply chain finance, and systemic risk.

### Current Projects

- 🦀 **Nexus** — Supply chain intelligence platform in Rust. Treats demand, lead times, and supplier reliability as probability distributions. Monte Carlo simulation, temporal graph kernel, agentic recommendations a procurement team can audit.
- 💳 **FyxCred** — Credit intelligence built on behavioral cashflow data, not bureau scores. Three scores — financial health, income stability, financial resilience — with a consent-first data layer and bias transparency framework.
- 🧠 **[AgenticMemory](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-memory)** — Persistent memory for AI agents. A binary graph format that stores facts, decisions, corrections, and reasoning chains with semantic edge types.
- 👁️ **[AgenticVision](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-vision)** — Persistent visual memory for AI agents with embeddings, similarity search, and visual diff.
- 🧩 **[AgenticCodebase](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-codebase)** — Semantic code intelligence for concept mapping, grounding, and impact analysis.
- 🪪 **[AgenticIdentity](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-identity)** — Cryptographic identity, trust delegation, and signed action receipts for agents.
- ⏱️ **[AgenticTime](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-time)** — Temporal reasoning for schedules, deadlines, decay models, and sequence-aware context.
- 📜 **[AgenticContract](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-contract)** — Policy contracts and governance controls for obligations, approvals, and violations.
- 📡 **[AgenticComm](https://github.com/agentralabs/agentic-comm)** — Structured communication layer for channels, pub/sub routing, and agent coordination.

### What I'm Doing

🦀 Building Nexus — a full supply chain OS in Rust with probabilistic planning and agentic recommendations  
💳 Speccing and starting FyxCred — cashflow-based credit intelligence for the credit invisible  
🧠 Building Agentra sister systems — memory, vision, codebase, identity, time, contract, and comm (MCP-native, artifact-portable infrastructure)  
📝 Reviewing AI and cybersecurity research for IEEE

### What I'm Thinking About

- What it actually means for an AI agent to be trustworthy over time — not just at launch
- How to operationalize explainability so adverse-action reasons can satisfy ECOA/FCRA requirements
- How credit scoring can work for people the formal system has historically excluded
- The memory and reasoning infrastructure agents need before they can operate in regulated environments
- African knowledge systems and their relationship to computation and intelligence
