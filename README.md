# Hi, I'm Omoshola 👋

**Building AI agents and the infrastructure they run on.**

I work at the intersection of agentic systems, financial AI, and regulatory governance — where the gap between what AI can do and what institutions can trust is still wide open. I build things that are architecturally precise, auditable, and honest about what they do not know.

### Current Projects

- 🦀 **Nexus** — Supply chain intelligence platform in Rust. Treats demand, lead times, and supplier reliability as probability distributions. Monte Carlo simulation, temporal graph kernel, agentic recommendations a procurement team can audit.
- 💳 **FyxCred** — Credit intelligence built on behavioral cashflow data, not bureau scores. Three scores — financial health, income stability, financial resilience — with a consent-first data layer and bias transparency framework.
- 🕸️ **[Cortex](https://github.com/agentic-revolution/agentic-vision)** — Web cartography for AI agents. Maps entire sites into navigable binary graphs in seconds. Ships with WQL (a query language for websites), LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen/MCP integrations.
- 🧠 **[AgenticMemory](https://github.com/agentic-revolution/agentic-memory)** — Persistent memory for AI agents. A binary graph format that stores facts, decisions, corrections, and reasoning chains with semantic edge types. 440+ tests, dual Python/Rust distributions, peer-reviewed research paper.

### Research & Explainable AI

- 🔬 **[Explainable Credit Intelligence](https://github.com/omoshola-o/explainable-credit-intelligence)** — SHAP-based interpretable risk scoring (CrossSHAP methodology)
- 🌐 **[Network Analysis — Supply Chain](https://github.com/omoshola-o/network_analysis_supply_chain)** — Systemic risk assessment in supply chains
- 🏦 **[Credit Risk Creditum](https://github.com/omoshola-o/credit-risk-creditum)** — Credit risk modeling and analysis
- 📊 **[RiskX](https://github.com/omoshola-o/riskx)** — Risk analytics engine
- 📄 **IEEE Academic Reviewer** — Peer reviewer for ICAD 2025
- 📐 **IEEE Standards Development** — AI ethics, cybersecurity, financial LLM requirements, supply chain security

### What I'm Doing

🦀 Building Nexus — a full supply chain OS in Rust with probabilistic planning and agentic recommendations
💳 Speccing and starting FyxCred — cashflow-based credit intelligence for the credit invisible
🕸️ Shipping Cortex — web cartography infrastructure for AI agents
🧠 Releasing AgenticMemory v0.2 — persistent, auditable memory for agents across any LLM
📝 Reviewing AI and cybersecurity research for IEEE

### What I'm Thinking About

- What it actually means for an AI agent to be trustworthy over time — not just at launch
- How credit scoring can work for people the formal system has historically excluded
- The memory and reasoning infrastructure agents need before they can operate in regulated environments
- African knowledge systems and their relationship to computation and intelligence
